Big Data Analysis and Green Computing: Profiling HPC Power and Tracking CO2 Emissions

###OBJECTIVE
                
----
Explore the world of Big Data Analysis in the context of high-performance computing (HPC), with a specific focus on two important aspects: power profiling and tracking CO2 emissions.â€‹

###BACKGROUND
                
----
Sustainable computing is increasingly vital in our digital era, especially within HPC systems. To achieve this goal, it is crucial to utilize big data analysis of HPC monitoring data.
